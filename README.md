* This project is my final project for bachelor's degree at FERIT.
* An application is intended for use between team members on a project. It offers options to members such as creating a project, commenting on a project, monitoring project progress, deleting project, editing project, filtering projects by category, adding project logs etc. In order for all of the above to be available, users must first register and login in to the application. An unregistered user is not allowed to use the application and is redirected to the login page every time he tries to use it. The code is written in Visual Studio Code. Technologies used for the interface are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React and Firebase for the backend.
* Project is live here: [project management app](projectmanagementsite-b7155.web.app)
